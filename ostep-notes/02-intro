==> What a running program does:
  - it executes instructions (billion of instructions ever second)
  ===> The Processor
    - fetches an instruction from memory
    - decodes it (figures out what instruction it is)
    - executes it (execute instruction)
    - after completed, moves onto next instruction until completion of program

==> Virtualization
  - Each process see their own virtual memory addresses
  - Is a layer inside the OS that intercepts requests for memory access from processes
  - Translating virtual memory address to actual physical address
  - When a process tries to read from or write to a memory address, it actually uses a virtual address (not physical address)
  - allows many programs to run and many programs to concurrently access their own instructions and data (thus sharing the physical memory), and many programs to access devices (thus sharing disks and so forth),
